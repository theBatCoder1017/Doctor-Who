    <p>The Doctor is from a species known as the Timelords.</p>
    <p>Timelords are beings who can travel through time and space and created the Tardis.</p>
    <p>Timelords have the ability to regenerate. When the body of a Timelord dies, it regenerates into a new body, which makes Timelords immortal. However, timelords can "turn off" their regeneration if they wanted to.</p>
    <p>Timelords have multiple enemies. Their main enemies are the Daleks. You can see a picture of Daleks below.</p>

    <p>A main goal in a Dalek's life is to destroy every thing that isn't a Dalek.</p>
    <p>So far, there have been 12 doctors.</p>
    <p>The current doctor is played by Peter Capaldi.</p>
    <p>Every Doctor has a companion because he wants someone to bring along on his journey and he gets lonely.</p>

    <p>In addition to the Tardis, another tool that the Doctor uses is a sonic screwdriver.</p>
