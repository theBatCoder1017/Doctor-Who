        <h1>What are Weeping Angels?</h>
    <p>Weeping Angels are quantum-locked humanoids. This means that they can only move when nothing is looking at them.</p>
    <p>They feed off of organisms' time energy. </p>
    <p>A Weeping Angel takes someone's time energy by making contact with them.</p>
    <p>A Weeping Angel either drops the victim into the past which allows them to still live their lives, but in a different time or it can just snap the victims neck and steal the time energy from their dead body.</p>
    <p>If a human would look away, turn their back, or blink a Weeping Angel will immediately try to steal their time energy.</p>
